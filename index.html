        <div class="subheading mb-5">HistoryðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a 19 year-old Korean-American boy from Torrance, California. I graduated from South High School and am currently a second-year full-time student in UC Riverside. I am currently involved in a Christian Korean-American club called KCM, or Korean-American Campus Missions. I love KCM. KCM is not a church. I joined KCM because they're all Korean, with a few exceptions. Since I was younger, I was bullied for being Asian and having small eyes. Because of that, I found community within my ethnic group. It was okay, though, because we all liked the same things! Anime, K-pop, Korean dramas, all of these things we had in common, so becoming close was not a difficult thing! These friends that I made because I was bullied by everyone else have become a big part of my life and I would not trade them for anything in the world, except maybe a Lamborghini.<br><br>

       Some of my favorite things to do in my free time are play games, look at cars, and talk to people I like. I sometimes get carried away and get distracted for long periods of time, but it's okay! Life is meant to be lived, not to use every second being productive, or else what's the point? :) A guilty pleasure of mine is watching rom-coms with my friends at home while eating popcorn and ice cream. Even though it is something not many people do, it brings me a joy in life that nothing else seems to provide. Some of my favorite movies are 50 First Dates, He's Just Not That Into You, and Pretty Woman. I have watched each of these movies over 5 times and I loved every minute. Nothing is better than curling up on the couch with some Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream and turning on one of these movies. It takes away all the stress of life and I don't have a care in the world.<br><br>

        One day, I hope to become a history teacher, while dabbling in some automobile sales or repair. Ever since I was little, I loved cars, ESPECIALLY the Disney movie! Because of this unhealthy obsesssion, I wish to one day study hard enough to make a somewhat stable income from this. Then, on a side job, I'll become a history teacher or something. I'm not SUPER into the idea of becoming a teacher, but hey, benefits and my entire summer off? Sounds good to me! Another goal that I want to achieve later in life is to get married. When I was 5 years old, my mom bought me a big Barbie dollhouse and I could not be separated from it. Every day, after kindergarten, I would run straight home to play with my dollhouse. I would play with the dolls and have them do all of these things together, like eat dinner, drive around, and have slumber parties! I hope to do the same things that I did in that dollhouse one day with my wife and kids. I think if I have that, then I would be happy, even if I did not have a job or did not make a lot of money.
